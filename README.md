# ImdbListAndChartsExtractor
Extracts imdb.com lists or charts out of imdb.com for use elsewhere.

Write the amount of movies and/or shows you would like to see from the list or chart to the right of "listLength=".
View an imdb.com list or chart's source in your browser and then paste it in the blank line underneath the "webPage="""" line of code.

This can be ran in an online interpreter, such as the following: https://www.online-python.com/

I made this so that imdb lists and charts can be pasted into random selection wheels, such as the following: https://wheelofnames.com/

You may have a couple lines of items at the top or bottom of the output that aren't from your imdb list depending on the interpreter you use, they should be fairly obvious to catch with a quick scan. The interpreter website I linked above has a couple blank lines and then a couple terminal output lines that should be ignored when copying or deleted if pasted into somewhere else.
